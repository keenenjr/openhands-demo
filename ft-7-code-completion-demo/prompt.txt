I have a code completion task for you that I need completed.

In 'code.py' there is a Student class.

Please implement the calculate_wam method to compute the Weighted Average Mark (WAM) based on the student's grades and corresponding credit points.
You can assume that all subjects are made up of 6 credit points.

Additionally, complete the generate_student_report function to produce a formatted report for a student which includes their name, subjects, grades, and WAM.
Please ensure that this report is in the same format as the sample report, provided in 'sample-report.txt'. 
Please convey the working solution with one sample student, who has atleast 3 grades for different subjects.
