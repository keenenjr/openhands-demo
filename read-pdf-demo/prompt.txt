__PROMPT 1__

Hey, I've uploaded my lecture slides in a pdf, which is in the file titled 'slides.pdf'. 
Can you summarise the content for me?

__PROMPT 2__

Can you expand on the basic c++ syntax with examples placed in a code file called 'syntax.cpp' in the workspace? 
Please ONLY include code samples from the slides, i.e., no code samples of your own.
