**Note:**
This demonstration focuses on showcasing how the OpenHands agent can read PDF files and extract the content.
Follow the steps below in the same order to recreate the demonstration video.
Please use the interface guides provided in the root directory if you are stuck on how to action a step.
If a filename is mentioned in this guide, the file's location will be in the same directory as this guide.

1. Create a new project.

2. Upload zip file titled 'slides.zip' to the new project (via ZIP File Upload)
    - **Note:** The slides in the 'slides.pdf' file are from an open-source software security analysis course that uses C++ as it's primary coding language. 

3. ENTER PROMPT (in Chatbox): "Hey, I've uploaded my lecture slides in a pdf, which is in the file titled 'slides.pdf'. Can you convert the pdf to text, and then summarise the content for me?" 

4. Navigate to the chat, and click on the 'Ran a Python Command' dropdown to see the code within.
    - View how the agent is able to convert pdf files to text.

5. ENTER PROMPT (in Chatbox): "Can you extract and expand on some basic C++ data types/variables with examples directly    from the 'slides.pdf' file and place them in a code file called 'syntax.cpp' in the workspace? Please ensure that only the code samples from the slides are used."

6. Open the 'syntax.cpp' file (via Code Explorer in the Workspace) and compare it to slide 9 of the 'slides.pdf' file.
    - View how the samples shown in 'syntax.cpp' are directly taken from the 'slides.pdf' file that was uploaded to the workspace.
