__PROMPT 1__

Hey, I've uploaded my lecture slides in a pdf, which is in the file titled 'slides.pdf'.  
Can you convert the pdf to text, and then summarise the content for me?

__PROMPT 2__

Can you extract and expand on some basic C++ data types/variables with examples directly from the 'slides.pdf' 
file and place them in a code file called 'syntax.cpp' in the workspace? Please ensure that only the code 
samples from the slides are used.
