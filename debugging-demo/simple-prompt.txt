Hey, this is my task for a university assignment:

Task Description 
You must create an Express.js API that retrieves user profile data from a simulated database and caches responses to improve performance. 
Expected Functionality: 
    - If a user requests GET /user/:id, the API should: Fetch the user data from a database (simulated). 
    - Cache the response so that subsequent requests return instantly without database access. 
    - Handle missing users gracefully by returning a 404 error.
    - The API must work for all valid and invalid inputs, including: 
        -- Existing users (/user/1, /user/2) Non-existent users (/user/999) 
        -- Multiple consecutive requests (to test caching) 
    - The cache must correctly store and retrieve data based on user ID type. 
    - There must be no hidden performance issues, memory leaks, or race conditions.

Could you please run my solution (in code.js) and ensure that it addresses all of these points?
Please debug any errors.   
If you need to change the code, please place the new code in 'code_updated.js', and leave the original file untouched.
